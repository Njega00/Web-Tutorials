    Deﬁning a heading:
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
    
<h1> deﬁnes the most important heading.
<h6> deﬁnes the least important heading.

    Example document (extra intendation to illustrate hierarchy):
<h1>Main title</h1>
<p>Introduction</p>
<h2>Reasons</h2>
<h3>Reason 1</h3>
<p>Paragraph</p>
<h3>Reason 2</h3>
<p>Paragraph</p>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>Paragraph</p>

The HTML <p> element deﬁnes a paragraph: 
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph</>
        Usng spaces within the paragraph in between texts does not add spaces , instead use <br> to add lines

        Text Formatting
        This involves formatting text such as highlighting, bolding ,underlining,subscript and sticken text
        <mark> is used to highlight text in a document "due to its relevance in another context"</mark>

        To bold use <strong>Bold text here </strong> or <b>Bold text here also</b>
        strong indicates that is is fundamentally /semantically important than the others

        Italic text uses <em> or <i> tags
            <em>This indicates that the text has extra emphasis</em>

            Underlined text uses <u>The above would be unerlined</u>

            To mark some expression as an abbreviation, use <abbr> tag:
<p>I like to write <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>!</p>

To mark text as inserted, use the <ins> tag:
<ins>New Text</ins>
To mark text as deleted, use the <del> tag:
<del>Deleted Text</del>
To strike through text, use the <s> tag:
<s>Struck-through text here</s>
